            I live in my ancestral home with my grandparents, parents, and siblings.
            My grandfather built this house with his hard work.
            It has four rooms, one <a href="kitchen.html">kitchen</a>, two <a href="bathroom.html">bathrooms</a>, and a patio.
            My house is at least fifty years old.
        </p>
        <p>
            I admire the beauty of my house.
            The vintage vibes make it even more beautiful.
            My grandparents have a small <a href="garden.html" target="_blank">garden</a> in the <a href="patio.html" target="_blank">patio</a> which adds greenery to my house.
            Moreover, it also has two trees. One is a pomegranate tree and the other is a Henna tree.
            They provide us with shade and sweet fruits.
        </p>
        <p>
            My house has very high ceilings as it was made many years back.
            It has vintage switchboards which give it a very unique look.
            My house is situated in the middle of four roads. It is not joined to any other house.
            My house has four entrances from each side.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever my friends come over to my house, they click a lot of pictures.
            Even my relatives love the interior of the house which is a mix of modern and vintage architecture.
            My house is colored in brown and beige color and it stands out in our <a href="#main">locality</a>.
