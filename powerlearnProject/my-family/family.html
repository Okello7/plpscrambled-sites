        <p>My family consists of five members, they are my <h2>father</h2>,
             my <h2>mother</h2>, me, my <h3>brother</h3> and my little <h4>sister</h4>. 
             My brother is older than me and he is in <h5>grade 9</h5>,
             while I am in <h6>grade 6</h6> and my sister is in grade 4.
              We are all in the same school, so we take the same bus in the morning and go to school together.
        </p>
        <p>My <h2>father</h2> works as an engineer in the electricity company,
             his work is very important, and he goes to work at eight in the morning,
              and my mother is a doctor, she works in a hospital near the house,
               so she goes to work on foot.</p>
        <p>In the morning everyone prepares to leave the house, my <h2>father</h2> and mother go to work, 
            me and my siblings go to our school, all the family members get up at six, 
            have breakfast at seven, and we leave the house at seven and half.</p>
        <p>The most important thing about my family</p>
        <p>System is the feature that distinguishes my family, 
            we are very organized and this saves a lot of effort and time.</p>
        <p>Each of us makes his bed and cleans his room, and we also help my mum to prepare the food, 
            we are very cooperative and help each other.</p>
